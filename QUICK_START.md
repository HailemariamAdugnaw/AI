# Quick Start Guide for Google Colab

## 🚀 Fastest Way to Get Started

### Option 1: Direct Colab Link (Coming Soon)
Once this repository is public, you can open the notebook directly in Colab:
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/HailemariamAdugnaw/AI/blob/main/weather_prediction.ipynb
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload (Works Right Now)

1. **Download the files** from this repository:
   - `weather_prediction.ipynb`
   - `seattle-weather.csv`

2. **Go to Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

3. **Upload the notebook**:
   - Click `File` → `Upload notebook`
   - Select `weather_prediction.ipynb`

4. **Run the notebook**:
   - Click `Runtime` → `Run all`
   - When prompted, upload `seattle-weather.csv`

5. **Enjoy the results**! 🎉

### Option 3: Using GitHub in Colab

1. Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Click on `File` → `Open notebook`

3. Select the `GitHub` tab

4. Enter: `HailemariamAdugnaw/AI`

5. Select `weather_prediction.ipynb`

6. Run the first cell to upload the CSV file

## 📊 What You'll Get

- **6 trained machine learning models** compared side-by-side
- **Beautiful visualizations** of the data and results
- **84%+ accuracy** in weather prediction
- **Example predictions** for different weather scenarios
- **Downloadable trained model** for future use

## ⏱️ Time Required

- Total runtime: ~2-3 minutes
- All steps are automated
- No coding knowledge required!

## 🎯 Expected Accuracy

Based on testing:
- **Random Forest**: ~84% (Usually the best)
- **Gradient Boosting**: ~83%
- **Logistic Regression**: ~77%
- **Decision Tree**: ~80%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: ~69%
- **Support Vector Machine**: ~73%

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use GPU** for faster training:
   - Click `Runtime` → `Change runtime type` → Select `GPU`

2. **Save your work**:
   - Click `File` → `Save a copy in Drive`

3. **Download results**:
   - The notebook will generate visualizations and trained models
   - You can download them at the end

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The upload button doesn't appear**
- Make sure you run the upload cell (it's in Step 1)

**Q: I get a "module not found" error**
- Run the installation cell in Step 2 first
- Wait for it to complete before running other cells

**Q: The model accuracy is different**
- This is normal due to randomization in training
- Results should be within 1-2% of the expected values

## 📝 Next Steps After Training

1. Try the example predictions in the notebook
2. Modify the input values to test different scenarios
3. Download the trained model (`.pkl` files)
4. Use the model in your own applications
